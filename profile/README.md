# Akamai Developers

Welcome to the place for builders who push the edge of what’s possible.

If you’re exploring what comes next in AI, LLM-powered experiences, cloud-native systems, serverless architectures, and WebAssembly, you’re in the right community.

At **Akamai Developers**, we share practical code, reference implementations, and experiments that help developers move from idea to production faster.

## What We’re Building Around

- **AI & LLMs**: Intelligent applications, retrieval workflows, and real-world AI patterns.
- **Cloud**: Scalable, resilient systems designed for modern global applications.
- **Serverless**: Event-driven development with less operational overhead.
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)**: High-performance, portable runtimes at the edge and beyond.

## Why This Community Exists
